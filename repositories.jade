	h2 Repositories
	p SyncIt started as just being local in-browser versioning but grew into into a few different projects / repositories.
	ul
		li
			a(href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/SyncIt") SyncIt
			span : was the original project, and the heart of the whole system. It does the versioning of local changes and enables you to load data into it (calling conflict resolution function if necessary) and get the changes which still need to be uploaded. It is vanilla JavaScript project so should be usable anywhere.
		li
			a(href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/syncit-server") SyncItServer
			span : is the reference server for SyncIt. The code is tested to work in Node under the Express framework using MongoDB though it is probably quite usable in other Node frameworks. The code here is pretty simple (much more so than SyncIt itself) and it should be possible to port it to many languages.
		li
			a(href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/SyncItControl") SyncItControl
			span : will hook into some SyncIt events and establish an EventSource into SyncItServer so it can synchronize changes between the two systems.
		li
			a(href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/SyncItBootstrap") SyncItBootstrap
			span : Base project incorporating all the above components into a ready-made bare bones project. This is the prefect start for building your own projects upon as it is already ready to go. There is also a TodoMVC branch based of the Facebook's React TodoMVC example.
